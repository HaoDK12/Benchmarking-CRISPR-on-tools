*Detail of Prediction of CRISPR/Cas9 on-target Editing Efficiency Tools* 

The prediction outcomes generated by different tools were primarily based on the source code provided by the corresponding articles or the websites developed. Of note, certain prediction outcomes of tools included efficiency predictions for the reverse target sequence of sgRNA. For the sake of fairness and convenience, these verbose results have also been filtered out. In detail, the predictions of DeepSpCas9 were calculated using the developed website, accessible at http://deepcrispr.info/DeepSpCas9. The predictions of DeepHF were obtained using the source code provided at https://github.com/izhangcd/DeepHF. The predictions of CRISPRon were implemented by using the source code provided at https://github.com/RTH-tools/crispron. The predictions of Rule set3 were calculated according to its source code at https://github.com/gpp-rnd/rs3, specifying the parameter of ‘Hus2013’ tracrRNA for the latter. The predictions of Azimuth 2.0 were obtained using the source code provided at https://github.com/microsoftResearch/azimuth, which optional parameters specifying the sgRNA's position within the gene weren’t considered. The predictions of CRISPRdict originated from the website https://www.crispredict.org/, with parameter selection of the U6/T7 promoter and the corresponding regression model. The results of sgDesigner were generated using the source code provided at https://github.com/wang-lab/sgDesigner.  Implementations of all the above tools were functionally tested in December 2023. The collected datasets, detailed prediction results, and processed scripts could be accessible at https://github.com/HaoDK12/Benchmarking-CRISPR-on-tools. **The overview of datasets and tools can be found in Supplementary Data 1, while the predictions from all tools are in Supplementary Data 2.**
